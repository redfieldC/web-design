      This <a class="plain" href="#">link will not be underlined</a>, as links
      generally are by default. Be careful when removing the text decoration on
      anchors since users often depend on the underline to denote hyperlinks.

    <p class="underover">This text has lines above <em>and</em> below it.</p>
    <p class="thick">
      This text has a really thick purple underline in supporting browsers.

      This text might blink for you, depending on the browser you use.
